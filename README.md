#Minimee

* Author: [John D Wells](http://johndwells.com)

## Version 1.1.3

* Requires: ExpressionEngine 2

## Description

Minimize, combine & cache your CSS and JS files. Because size DOES matter.

Minimee is to EE2 what SL Combinator is to EE1.  But with a few twists:

* works with the global variables, even {stylesheet}
* works with external files, over cURL or file_get_contents()
* embed combined & minified content directly inline to your template
* queue files for later
* compatible with server-side compression & caching

Minimee is inspired and influenced by [SL Combinator](http://experienceinternet.co.uk/software/sl-combinator/) from Experience Internet, and [Carabiner Asset Management Library](http://codeigniter.com/wiki/Carabiner/) from Tony Dewan. It is released under a BSD License.
