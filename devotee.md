###Minimee<sup>2</sup> is out!

Minimee watches your filesystem for changes to your CSS & JS assets, and automatically combines, minifies & caches these assets whenever changes are detected. It can also detect changes to stylesheet templates (whether saved as files or not).

Version 2's substantial re-write has ushered in a host of changes big and small. It is the same Minimee you've come to rely on, with more power, intelligence, and fun-ness.

####Features Include:

* works with the global variables, even <code>&#123;stylesheet=&#125;</code>
* works with external files, over cURL or file_get_contents()
* new output options
* minify your HTML
* fine-grained, per-asset configuration abilities
* purpose-built compatibility with RequireJS, LABjs, etc
* queue files for later, irrespective of the Parse Order
* hooks for 3rd party integration
* API for 3rd party add-ons
* compatible with server-side compression & caching
